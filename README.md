# Hack-at-WPI-2022

This project provides a secure way to log in to an Arduino-like microcontroller - an ESP32 - by using Bluetooth Low Energy proximity scanning to detect a personal device and a servo to enter a password. Once both conditions are met, the user will be securely signed in to the ESP32.
